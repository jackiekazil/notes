## Data for classfication

## Ingrediants we need
* Classficiation schema
* Labelled train/test set
* Numberical /Boolean Features
* A classifier
* An evaluation metric

## Classification system
* Malay
* Chinese
* English
* (more)

Labelled train/test set
* Labeled 10% of the data, then used that to classify the next 10%
* Then hand corrected that and used that as the training set
* With this approach, we were able to have less errors as we classified every set of data.

## Choosing features: N-Grams
unigrams
bi-grams
n-grams

## Choosing Features: N-grams
Road names that include bigram 'ck' -- most likely in British.
Different languages have different rates of various n-grams

Linear support vector classification (SVC)
SVC - we choose the line that has the line that maximizes the space between the two datasets.

^^ Has recommended reading.

## Adding Feature Union

After adding features...
We got to 65% accuracy

Summary
* Using pipelines and feature unions ...

(Too much info for the time. :-( There is a lot that was missed. This is a very rich talk though and if you are interested, you should go and watch the video.)
