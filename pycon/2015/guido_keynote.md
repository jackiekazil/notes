# Guido van Rossum Keynote

** Apr 11th at 9:00 AM until 9:40 AM **

## Python 3

* Does the job better; takes porting effort
    * futurize etc. can help
* Finds real use
* But on pypi, Python 2 still rules:
    * 5000+ packages on PyPy ported to 3
    * 55000+ not yet ported

### To port to Python 3

Example: You create a little library, called The Ulimate Data Picker, that you leave on PyPi. Then you become the BDL for that package. But you now retired and you grow grapes. Are you responsible for upgrading that? Everyone is looking at you.

Suggestion: What if there was a place that people can adopt open source packages that other people can adopt or create partnerships?

How do we get

## Pep 484

[Pep 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)

* Don't worry, Python is not "getting types"
* We're just agreeing on the standard notation for function annotations for use by those who care (IDE, Google, mypy, ...)
* Come to my keynote Sunday afternoon

## Diversity

* Python in Iraq! 50% women.
* No women at the language summit. :-(
* Want at least two female core devs next year
* First q. from a woman or girl, then alternate

(My additions after this point...  )
