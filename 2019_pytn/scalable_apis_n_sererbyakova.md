# Scalable APIs with microservices with Python

Speaker: Natalie Sererbyakova


Zookeeper - used as a registry of micro services

How will it be monitored and measured?

## A microservice skeleton
* setup.py: Distutils' setup file, which is used to install and relase the project
* Makefile: A Makefile that contains a few useful targets to make, build, and run a project
* Project dependencies following the pip format
* Actual package code (Python code)
* Dockerfile
* Kubernetes spec file
